👋 Hi, I’m Martin

I build tools and systems around **automation**, **trading**, and **cloud infrastructure**.

Most of my public work lives here:

- **Azule** — shell tooling & automation  
- **lumibot** — trading & backtesting framework  

A lot of what I work on day-to-day is **production systems** and **private repos**  
(cloud services, trading infra, orchestration).

Feel free to check out the pinned projects below — code > words.
